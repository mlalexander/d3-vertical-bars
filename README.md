Vertical bar chart
=====================

A vertical D3 bar chart of Missouri foster children taking psychoactive medication in FY2014 by drug class

Children who are taking more than one drug in a given class are only counted once for said drug class.
For example, if a child were on 2 ADHD medications, they would be counted as 1 child in the ADHD class.
If a child is taking an ADHD medication and an antipsychotic, they would be counted as 1 child in ADHD and 1 child in antipsychotics.
